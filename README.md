## Done
  * Root-Mean-Square simulation that is fairly performant in Javascript

## Todo
  * Improve accuracy of model based on real LCD results
  * Slider to change simulation speed
  * Code box to allow algorithm changes at runtime
  * Provide example algorithm that uses basic algorithm of graphical LCDs (low contrast)
  * Knobs for temperature, driving voltage, etc.
